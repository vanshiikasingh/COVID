# COVID
In this project, I used COVID19 dataset, consisting of the data related tocumulative number of
  -Confirmed cases

  -Recovered cases

  -Deaths cases

Through this dataset, I answered questions like:

  -How does the Global spread of the virus look like?

  -How intensive the spread of the virus has been in the countries?

  -Does COVID19 lockdowns and self- isolations in different countries have actually had an impact on the virus transmission?
